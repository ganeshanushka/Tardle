# Tardle : [The Ultimate Tar Heel Word Challenge](https://ganeshanushka.github.io)

Welcome to Tardle, an innovative spin-off of the widely popular game, wordle.

This game is not just for UNC students but also for word game enthusiast as well as fans and members of the UNC Chapel Hill community. Whether your a current student, an alumnus, or simply a fan of the Tar Heels, Tardle offers an engaging way to celebrate and connect with our university's unmatched spirit.

Developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, Tardle is a testament to the power of simple yet powerful web technologies in creating fun user experiences. It's a playful, interactive game that brings together the Tar Heel community through shared knowledge and love for UNC Chapel Hill.
