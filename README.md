# Tardle : [The Ultimate Tar Heel Word Challenge](https://ganeshanushka.github.io)

This game is not just for UNC students but also for word game enthusiast as well as fans and members of the UNC Chapel Hill community. Whether your a current student, an alumnus, or simply a fan of the Tar Heels, Tardle offers an engaging way to celebrate and connect with our university's unmatched spirit.

Developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, Tardle is a testament to the power of simple yet powerful web technologies in creating fun user experiences.
